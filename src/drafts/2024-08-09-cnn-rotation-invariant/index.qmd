Why is a convolutional neural network (CNN) not rotation invariant?

This question popped up in an interview recently. I was able to reason why it is not rotation invariant, especially since it is quite well-known in the literature; but I was not happy to not be able to prove it mathematically in my head. Today I am to put this question to bed with a somewhat acceptable proof.

Let's get one important thing out of the way first because this might confuse some people. The statement "CNN is not rotation invariant" does not imply that a CNN cannot learn filters that recognize rotation of an image. You can do so via data augmentation, 



## Equivariant or invariant?
