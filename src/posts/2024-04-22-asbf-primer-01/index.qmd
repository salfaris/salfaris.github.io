# What is ASB financing

ASB financing is a financing tool to maximize investment in Malaysia's ASB (Amanah Saham Berhad) unit trust fund. It is an excellent product for Bumis (controversial... I know). Essentially, it allows for leverage with only interest as a risk; which is great not just for consumers but with such few parameters, it makes modelling easy as well. Unfortunately, albeit expected, there's not much arbitrage in this space – maybe only reverse arbitrage where financial institutions can screw consumers over.

But risk is risk and I want to minimize loss and regrets to the lowest low. Like all investments, betting strats and literally anything that involves counting numbers, I like to think of parities – for example, how does a $1 injection in a risk-free investment compares to one with risk? If there is zero difference, then it is obvious to go with the risk-free asset. We will be reasoning in this exact same line.

# Decision parity

I am going to put some numbers down so that the parity justification makes more sense. If I have some disposable RM20,000 to invest, an investment in ASB without financing with a dividend rate of 5% would yield me RM1000. However, with financing at a 4% interest rate, the same RM20,000 would yield me only RM200. Ouch, not great. So how do we achieve parity assuming interest and dividend rates are fixed? Well, you would have to take financing with a starting capital of RM100,000. So I would have to take a loan that is 5x the value of my disposable starter. Is this worth it? 

Note that you take financing over a set amount of years so the interest rate can change with years. But the dividend rate is the same regardless if you take financing or not so we can essentially treat it as constant. Let's look at what happens if we perturb the interest rate a bit assuming the dividend rate holds at 5%. Again take a starting capital of RM100,000. With each 1% interest rate decrement, we see that the yield doubles from RM1000 to RM2000 and then to RM3000 and eventually to RM5000 where the interest rate is zero. So if the interest rate behaves stochastically (as it should), we should see some good years where the returns can get lucrative. Just think about the amount of disposable capital you need to have to attain these returns – it scales 2x with each 1% interest rate decrement. So to attain a RM3000 return, you need RM60,000 to start with which can be quite a jump.

*Just a short disclaimer that there can be terrible years as well if the dividend rate falls below the interest rate. As of 2024, we are seeing ASB stabilizing a bit despite the terrible Malaysian market conditions and [insane amount of foreign funds outflow](https://www.isaham.my/foreign-funds). So we shouldn't be seeing a crossover between the two rates anytime soon unless BNM starts to do something funny possibly due to global economy forcing Malaysia to be reactive.*

So how do we formalize the parity argument in this context? Can we give answer to questions like "how much starting capital should I need before the risk due to premiums becomes unprofitable so that I can focus on investment without financing"? I aim to answer questions like these in the future where we look into annual movements and observe with a closer lens the dynamics of interest, dividend and reinvested capital – this sounds like a three-body problem and the maths can get musty real quick. This post, however, is a primer to set up a tool so we can reason about what I just said in a logical way.

# Mathematical primer

An investment capital $C$ yields a return of $f(C; d) = f(C) = dC$ with dividend rate $d$. With financing, the returns get discounted with an interest rate $r$ so an initial capital $C$ yields a return of $\tilde{f}(C; d, r) = \tilde{f}(C) = dC(1-r) = f(C)(1-r)$. Observe that these are linear functions in $C$ (and even in $d$ and $r$). Rather than considering this specific form, let's make this model more useful and generalize this. Just thinking of returns that scale with capital and nothing else, we expect returns to be strictly monotone and hence, invertible. So let's assume our return functions obey that.

With this in place, we can now reason about parity under this framework. Let $f$, $\tilde{f}$ be returns without and with financing respectively. Let $C_1 > 0$ be your disposable capital; $C_1$ should be the capital that maximizes $f$ as you can always invest any capital $C \leqslant C_1$ without financing. Then parity in ASB financing is attain at a capital $C_2$ that satisfies $C_2 > C_1$ where the returns with financing is at least equivalent to returns in the interest-free investment. In our framework, $C_2$ is a capital that satisfies $\tilde{f}(C_2) = f(C_1)$. But remember that we assume strict monotonocity on $\tilde{f}$, so this means we can simply invert $\tilde{f}$ to get $C_2 = \tilde{f}^{-1}(f(C_1))$. And that's it!

Using returns in the linear setting, we have $\displaystyle C_2 = \frac{f(C_1)}{d(1-r)} = \frac{C_1}{1-r}$. And we can compute the parity difference $\Pi(C_1, C_2) := |C_2 - C_1|$ where in the linear setting reduces to:

$$
\Pi(C_1, C_2) = |C_2 - C_1| = C_1 \left| \frac{r}{1-r} \right|.
$$

Using parity difference, we recover the same conclusion we did before that with each 1% interest rate decrement, we see the parity difference getting smaller by approximately RM1000 and eventually converges to 0 as the interest rate goes to zero.

## Measuring poor financing choices with curves

Recall that returns is a function of capital, but also assumes a fixed dividend and interest rate $r$. By relaxing the interest rate $r$ assumption in $\tilde{f}(C; d, r)$, we see that $r$ defines the family of *financed* curves $\tilde{f}(C, r; d)$. If we further relax the fixed dividend rate $d$ assumption, we obtain a wider family of linear curves for both $f(C, d, r)$ and $\tilde{f}(C, d, r)$. So how can we measure which *financed* curves are worse? One metric that we can use is the area enclosed between $f$ and $\tilde{f}$, bounded by the minimum and maximum of $f$. This is probably not the best metric, but it works based on some hand computations (happy to be proven wrong!). Let $C_0$ be the minimum amount of invested capital where $0 \leqslant C_0 \leqslant C_1$; this should be the value that minimizes $f$. Then using very basic geometry, you can obtain this metric as the following quantity:

$$
\begin{align*}
\mathrm{Loss}(f, \tilde{f}) &= \int_{C_0}^{C_1} \left(f(C) - \min_{C} f(C)\right) \mathrm{d}C + \int_{C_1}^{C_2} \left(\max_{C} f(C) - \tilde{f}(C)\right) \mathrm{d}C \\
&= \int_{C_0}^{C_1} \left(f(C) - f(C_0)\right) \mathrm{d}C + \int_{C_1}^{C_2} \left(f(C_1) - \tilde{f}(C)\right) \mathrm{d}C.
\end{align*}
$$

So a good financing option – where interest rate is minimized – should be where the loss metric above is minimized. It is rather tedious to compute this. Thankfully, however, there is an equivalence between this metric and the parity difference, suggesting that it suffices to look at the parity difference.

If one examines the loss function above, one observe that the first part is entirely defined by $f$. This quantity acts only as a bias in the loss computation. Rather, the second quantity is what we should care about. Observe that this term is minimized if the integral range $[C_1, C_2]$ is minimized, and that was exactly the parity difference we defined before!

# So what have we learnt?

In this post, we looked at formalizing parity differences in investing in ASB with and without financing. From there, we build a metric to measure poor financing choices using a geometrical approach. This formalism gives us a tool to logically reason, for example, on finding a comfortable threshold for taking a loan to invest.

What next? From here, we can use this formalism to measure  annual compound returns either via a deterministic or stochastic approach. Running simulations should also be straightforward using this framework.

With this formalism, the best answer I can give (to myself, this is not investment advice!) on what set level to start taking financing is the following: given a disposable investment amount $C_1$, take financing for ASB if the initial financing amount satisfies $C_2 = \tilde{f}^{-1}(f(C_1))$ such that $\log C_2/C_1 \approx 1$. It will be fun to see how this changes when we consider annual dynamics.
