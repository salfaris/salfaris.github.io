I've been an active [blogger](http://salmanfariss.blogspot.com) since 2011 up until 2016 (although most of the earlier contents are now hidden due to cringiness) where I talked about various things â€“ life events, some tech stuff and my scholarship interview experiences. I stopped blogging when I started my International Baccalaureate (IB) diploma program. Throughout my undergraduate years, I channelled most of my writing energy answering IB questions on [Quora](https://www.quora.com/profile/Salman-Faris-44) and writing my notes using LaTeX. Today, I've decided to start blogging again, focusing on math, statistics and ML.

Do note that in the early stages of this blog, the contents might be inconsistent or quite random. This is because I am still finding the right pace and momentum in writing and generating content. Thanks for understanding!
