I am currently a Senior Data Scientist at Dyson, helping decision making at the highest level in Dyson's new Home Business Unit. I spent my 9-5 dealing with Python, SQL, PySpark, GCP (BigQuery, DataProc, Pub/Sub, among others), on top of mentoring and leading the data science aspects in my team. 

Prior to work, I graduated from the University of Oxford with an MSc in Advanced Computer Science. Before that, I graduated from King's College London with a BSc in Mathematics.

When I'm not writing code, I practice on the piano and run outdoors nowadays. I also enjoy a good game of table tennis and poker.

My tech stack has changed over the years, with some technologies I haven't used for quite a while now. This is a good overview of what I still have in my mind:

- Programming languages: Python, R, C/C++ (basic experience)
- Big data and cloud: PySpark, GCP, AWS (I use it a lot, but not manage)
- Data analysis: SQL, PyData stack, Plotly
- ML & stats modelling: PyMC3, scikit-learn, statsmodels, scipy, PyTorch, Jax
- Web & dashboard: HTML/CSS/JavaScript, ReactJS, Flask, Streamlit
- Others: Git, LaTeX, NetworkX
