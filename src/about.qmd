I am currently a Senior Data Scientist at Dyson, helping decision making at the highest level in Dyson's new Home Business Unit. I spend my 9-5 dealing with Python, SQL, PySpark, GCP (BigQuery, DataProc, Pub/Sub, App Engine, Vertex AI, among others), on top of mentoring and leading the data science side in my team.

Prior to work, I studied Mathematics at King's College London and got my BSc, then did my MSc in Advanced Computer Science at the University of Oxford.

When I'm not writing code, I like to explore new hobbies. Most recently, I picked up cycling and running. I enjoy good acoustic music and always down for a game of table tennis or poker.

My tech stack has changed over the years, with some technologies I haven't used for quite a while now. This is a good overview of what I still have in my mind:

- Programming languages: Python, R, (prior experience), C/C++ (prior experience)
- Data analysis: SQL, PySpark, PyData stack, Plotly, NetworkX, Google BigQuery, AWS Redshift (yes, I've used both).
- ML & stats modelling: scikit-learn, statsmodels, scipy, PyMC3, PyTorch, Jax
- Web & dashboard: HTML/CSS/JavaScript, Tableau, ReactJS, Flask, Streamlit
- Deployment: Git, Docker, Google Cloud Platform (GCP) stack, AWS Redshift
- Others: LaTeX
