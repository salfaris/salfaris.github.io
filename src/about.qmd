I am currently studying for an [MSc in Advanced Computer Science](https://www.ox.ac.uk/admissions/graduate/courses/msc-advanced-computer-science) at the University of Oxford. I recently graduated from King's College London with a BSc in Mathematics.

Previously, I was an Undergraduate Research Fellow at the [Department of Mathematics, King's College London](https://www.kcl.ac.uk/mathematics), under the supervision of Dr. Izaak Neri. There, I worked on exploring a new method to visualise large food webs, and in more generality, large complex networks.

I am very passionate about data science and machine learning. I like to view data science as detective work. It starts with a mystery, and you have to think hard of asking the right questions to find potential culprits. You'd then have to collect evidence to verify whether these culprits are guilty or not.

It's the same with data â€“ you start with a problem, and you have to ask the right questions in hope of moving towards the potential solution. You'd then have to verify whether these are actually solutions, probably by using some statistical technique.

When I'm not writing code, you can find me playing table tennis or poker (and recently, Avalon) in the MCR.

My tech stack includes:

- Programming languages: Python, R, C/C++ (prior experience)
- Data analysis: SQL, numpy, pandas, matplotlib/seaborn, Plotly
- ML & stats modelling: RStan, PyMC3, scikit-learn, statsmodels, scipy, PyTorch
- Web & dashboard: HTML/CSS/JavaScript, ReactJS, Flask, Streamlit
- Others: Git, LaTeX, NetworkX
