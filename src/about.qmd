### experience

I am currently a machine learning engineer at Lloyds Banking Group üè¶ working on exciting greenfield projects in the personalization space within the bank.

I was a data scientist at Dyson where I've helped critical decision-making for ~10 Dyson products including supporting the 5-year Home strategy plan. There, I've brought an estimate of 4m+ people into the Dyson comms funnel through Dyson's first-ever [Global Air Quality Research project](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PD-x8FiFQ-M) and various Dyson Air Quality backpack projects. I was also the data science lead in the Home Business Unit and have consulted on mathematical modelling, data science and data acquisition across various different teams within Dyson.

Prior to work, I studied Mathematics at King's College London, and then Computer Science at Keble College, University of Oxford.

### what I enjoy

When I'm not writing code, I like to learn new things and sharpen my skills.

Most recently, I'm learning ice skating and trying to aim for Skate Excellence Grade 3. I am also sharpening my chess knowledge on openings - currently ~memorizing~ mastering the Scotch gambit.

In 2025 so far, I've been learning to speak the Saudi dialect, playing around with a Raspberry Pi, did 30+ hours of Google Cloud training and strengthening my Vim skills among many other things.

I enjoy good acoustic music and am always down for a game of table tennis, poker or chess. I used to enjoy video gaming a lot but just don't find the time anymore. Some of my favorite games are Hoyle Majestic Chess 2003, Dune 2000, Spore. The most recent game I played was Far Cry 6 and that was hella fun. 

### tech stack 

My tech stack has changed over the years, with some technologies I haven't used for quite a while now. I've done a good chunk of web dev, a bit of iOS mobile dev and a lot of research and applied machine learning. Here's my active stack:

- Languages: Python, SQL // _Prior experiences in R, C, Swift_
- Data pipelines: Apache Airflow & Google Cloud Composer, PySpark, Vertex AI Pipelines 
- Machine learning: Scikit-Learn, PyTorch, JAX, PyMC  
- Deployment: Git, Docker, Terraform
- Data analysis: NumPy, Pandas, Plotly, NetworkX 
- Web development: HTML/CSS/JavaScript, React.js, Flask, Streamlit
- Others: LaTeX

I am also ~recently!~ a Google Cloud Certified Associate Cloud Engineer.
